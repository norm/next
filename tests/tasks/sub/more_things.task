# More things to do

Introductory paragraph.

* another thing not to do
* [ ] another thing to do
    * [ ] before 'another thing', do this
    * [ ] before 'another thing', do this too

Bulleted lists do not have to start with an asterisk, plusses and dashes
are also suitable markers.

+ [ ] pluses are things to do

- [ ] hyphens are things to do too
